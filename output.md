Welcome to the code review tool
>Hi. I'm trying to contribute to this codebase and I'm not an expert but I'm confused and don't know where to start.

Let's get
 you up to speed and ready to contribute. Here's a breakdown to guide you:


**1. Project Structure**

* **frontend:** This is the directory
 for your React application, containing all the source code for the front end.
    * **public:** This folder holds static files like images, fonts, and
 the `index.html` file.
    * **src:**  This is the heart of your React codebase, with components, styles, API interactions, and
 more.
        * **components:**  Holds reusable UI components.
        * **styles:** Contains CSS files for styling.
        * **api:**  Handles communication with the backend (API calls).
        * **hooks:**
Custom hooks to extract logic and reuse code.
        * **context:**  Used for global state management (e.g., authentication).
    * **README.md:**  Provides instructions for getting started with the project.
    * **
package.json:** Lists project dependencies and scripts for running the application.

* **backend:** (Likely not included in the provided files, but you'll need it) This is where the backend server resides.

**2. Understanding the Files**

* **README.md:** This is your entry point for
 project information. It explains how to run the application and build it for production.
* **package.json:** This file lists all the libraries and packages used in the project. It also defines scripts for various tasks like starting the development 
server (`npm start`) or creating a production build (`npm run build`).
* **
src/App.js:**  This is the main component of your application. It defines the routing structure, and how different components are displayed based on the URL.
* **src/index.js:** This is where the React application is bootstrapped and rendered into the `index.html` file.
* **src
/context/AuthContext.js:** This file manages authentication state and handles user login/logout.
* **src/hooks/auth/**.js:**  These files contain custom hooks related to authentication (e.g., `useSignup`, `useLogin`, `useLogout`).
* **src/components/**.js:**
  These files hold UI components (e.g., `Navbar`, `Hero`, `Products`, `Cart`).
* **src/api/axiosConfig.js:** This file sets up the Axios library for making API calls to the backend.
* **src/api/config/routes.js:** Defines the
 URLs (endpoints) for your API requests.
* **src/styles/**.modules.css:**  These are CSS files that contain styles for the components.

**3. How Frontend and Backend Interact**

* **API Calls:** The frontend uses Axios (configured in `src/api/axiosConfig.js
`) to send requests to the backend server. These requests are directed to specific endpoints defined in `src/api/config/routes.js`.
* **Data Transfer:** The backend sends responses back to the frontend as JSON data. These responses can contain user information, product data, or other information.
* **Authentication:**
  The frontend uses the `AuthContext` (in `src/context/AuthContext.js`) to manage the user's authentication status. This is typically done with tokens (access token and refresh token) stored in localStorage.

**4. Getting Started with Contributions**

1. **Set Up the Environment:**
    * **
Backend:**  Ensure you have a backend server running (e.g., Express, Django).  You'll need the project files and instructions to set it up.
    * **Frontend:**
        * Install Node.js and npm (comes with Node.js).
        * Navigate to the `frontend` directory in
 your terminal.
        * Run `npm install` to install project dependencies.
2. **Run the Frontend:**
    *  Run `npm start` to start the development server. This will open the application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
3. **Identify a
 Contribution:**
    *  Review the project's `README.md` and issues (if using a platform like GitHub).
    *  Find a task that interests you and that you're comfortable with.
4. **Develop and Test:**
    *  Make your changes in the appropriate files (e
.g., components, styles, hooks).
    *  Test your changes thoroughly in the browser.
5. **Create a Pull Request:**
    *  If you're working on a project with a team, create a pull request on GitHub or your chosen version control system.

**5. Examples
 of Contributions**

* **Add a new component:** Create a new component in the `src/components` folder and add it to the routing structure in `src/App.js`.
* **Fix a bug:**  Identify a bug, fix it in the relevant file, and test your solution.
*
 **Improve styling:** Update CSS in `src/styles` to make the application look better.
* **Add API calls:**  Create new API endpoints in the backend and write code to make requests to them from the frontend using Axios.

**Important Tips:**

* **Start Small:** Don't try to
 tackle massive tasks right away. Begin with smaller, more manageable contributions.
* **Communicate:** If you're working on a team, communicate with others about your contributions.
* **Read the Code:** Familiarize yourself with the existing codebase before making changes.
* **Follow Style Guides:**  Adhere to the
 project's existing code style and conventions.
